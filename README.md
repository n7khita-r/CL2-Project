🔧 Installation

To set up the environment, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

All experiments were run using Python 3.x with the libraries listed in requirements.txt.

🚀 Running the Code

All main scripts are located in the code/ directory. You can run the full pipeline—from feature extraction to model evaluation—using the provided driver scripts.

Confusion matrices and summary files will be saved automatically in the results/ directory.

📊 Results

All experimental outputs (feature ablations, hyperparameter analyses, performance tables, and plots) are stored inside results/.
This directory also includes summary .txt files produced by each training script.

Thank you!
